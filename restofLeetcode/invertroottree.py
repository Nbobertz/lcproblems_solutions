#here we are going to be given a binary tree and will have to invert the entire tree. This is a good problem to understan the basics of trees and can allow us to learn about inversion or recursion.

# def solution():
#     if not root:
#         return None
#
#     # swap children of tree
#     tmp = root.left
#     root.left = root.right
#     root.right = tmp
#
#     # recursivly call function to iterate through. Will continue until root is None
#     self.invertTree(root.left)
#     self.invertTree(root.right)
#     return root

#need to submit on LC because I don't have tree.
