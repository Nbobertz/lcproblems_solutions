# Purpose of this journal is to provide a log of the Data Structures an algorithms that I am working on after work.

## Day 1: 07/27/25 (Getting Started and Arrays)
I have done about 200 leetcode questions and have a pretty solid grasp of everything but it still takes me about 20 minutes to solve a medium problem. The idea here is to get to the point that I can solve a hard first try in about 20 minutes. It's going to take time, but fortunately it is possible.

I am a software engineer during the day but need to get better. This is a great medium to do it. I plan to follow the [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) roadmap for the first 50 days and aim to do two or three problems a day.

I will brush up on arrays and hashmaps today.

Did two sum and learned about the python.items() function to iterate through dictionary items. Also did group anagrams and learned the trick about grouping via aski values. A tricky question where you have to know the trick
