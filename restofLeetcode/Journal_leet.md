# Purpose of this journal is to provide a log of the Data Structures an algorithms that I am working on after work.

## Day 1: 07/27/25 (Getting Started and Arrays)
I have done about 200 leetcode questions and have a pretty solid grasp of everything but it still takes me about 20 minutes to solve a medium problem. The idea here is to get to the point that I can solve a hard first try in about 20 minutes. It's going to take time, but fortunately it is possible.

I am a software engineer during the day but need to get better. This is a great medium to do it. I plan to follow the [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) roadmap for the first 50 days and aim to do two or three problems a day.

I will brush up on arrays and hashmaps today.

Did two sum and learned about the python.items() function to iterate through dictionary items. Also did group anagrams and learned the trick about grouping via aski values. A tricky question where you have to know the trick

## Day2: 07/29/25: Arrays and Hashmaps
Got pretty good at iterating through an array and hashmap tonight. There are still some problems which are hard. Namely the ones that require you to stop and think about the solution or ones that use bitwise.

I did the valid palindrome question and the optimol solution was the bitwise one; which nobody would get in an interview but I guess I will have to memorise it. Essentially the ~ operator will flip all bits and you can compare directlly; this is a O(1) solution since all you have to do is just flip and judge to see if the bits match up.

## Day3: 07/30/25: Two Pointer, Array and Hashmaps
Today was a good day, did three problems and got through all 3. Two of them I had to look at the most efficent solution. This was because one of them requires you to const a memo and then edit it as you go through the problem. This was product of array except self.

The one pass soluion is a bit cracked. You have to do range(n-1,-1,-1) which says take the range of n, go backwards to -1, and the step is -1. To do this on the spot in an interview is a bit mean but some interverviewers be like that.

Anyways, it was a good day for DSA because it's all starting to come back now.

## Day4: 07/31/25: Two Pointer, 3Sum
Did 3 sum today and it broke me; spent about an hour on it learning diffrent ways to iterate through. Understand a majority of it but failed to see the implication. I will have to do it again before moving on.

Overall good day though; work thinks I do hobby work at the office which sucks. I built an AI-Program but they think I am just messing around. Kinda sucks but whatever.

## Day5: 08/1/25: Two Pointer, 3 Sum Smaller
Did 3 sum smaller today along with several other LC problems. The problem is that I am having a hard time grasping the inheret problem and assuming to much. I need to slow down; it's insane that you have to do these problems hundreds of times to get a job but its whatever.

I did the smaller version of it and I am tired of failing to grasp and move the pointers properly. I will continue to try

## Day6: 08/02/25: Array Based Questions
I have come to the conclusion that I am going to follow the neetcode roadmap but do all the leetcode questions for that topic before doing the neetcode ones. I just need to spend more time on these algorithms.

I did a couple of array based problems today. Going to see if I can get my haircut and then come back to the grind.

## Day7: 08/03/25: Array Based Questions
Did an easy today that I just could not get. I continue to overthink and impliment extremly hard solutions to what should be simple problems. I will continue to work hard and hopefully be able to solve mediums in under 20 minutes first try. I think at this rate I might be about 20 days off.

## Day8: 08/05/25: Two Pointer Problems
Did most water today (medium) it was about finding the largest container to hold water. I ahve done the hard version of this problem before.
Got the brute force approach but could not get the optimal without help. 

## Day 9: 08/07/25: Did A Graph Problem Today
Did the number of islands problem today. It's a classic graph problem that I think is one of the best leetcode problems out there. Got it after several attempts; did the iterative solution.

## Day 10: 08/10/24: Did Wiggle Sort
Tooday I did wiggle sort, it's a pretty cool problem on how to fix an array in real time. I would recomend doing this one as it shows how you can edit an array in place without storing and returning anything. A solid way to change things.

Also did the max consecutive one's problem. Got the algorithm down but failed to get the impimentation down. I need to brush up on my sliding window algorithm to make sure I can get it first try.

Did this in a group of people so it was more difficult.

## Day 11: 09/16/25: Did Bucket sort
Dropped off for a month. Grandpa died and I got sent to DC for work but now I am back on the grind. Did bucket sort today so that was pretty cool.
Still working on getting better.

## Day 12: 09/17/25: Did A stack Problem
Did a common stack problem and managed to get the brute force solution first try. It was a medium, so I guess that is new. Still I have alot to go.
Also I did the easy valid parenthesis problem. The logic is what gets me on it but I understand how a stack works.

## Day 13: 09/18/25: Did two stack problems
Did two stack problems today. One of them I brute forced my way through and got an O(n*m) solution. It was find next greater integer. The proper way to do it was with a monotonic(linear) stack. I need to get better at grasping these stack problems. For some reason I am good with graphs, but stacks...noooo... lol.

Anyways, standard day. Tomarrow I will try to get a problem in but I need to go to a concert.

## Day 14: 09/20/25: Did Bucket Sort Today at Kava bar
Yesterday I had to go to a concert so I did not get a chance to do a new problem. Today I did bucket sort again to make sure I got it down.

Will probobly do another one before bed.

## Day 15: 09/21/25: Did Bucket Sort Again and Car Fleet
Did bucket sort with colors today as well as with car fleet problem. The car fleet one I missed because I was trying to calculate each car as if it was on a track and not just do the time to complete and have some logic.
It's one of those problems where if you have done it before you will pass easily.

The bucket sort colors one was pretty intresting. I did it at work by using a LLM model to give me a random problem.

## Day 16: 09/22/25: Did an easy that I did not get today
I did dominoes 1128 today. I did not get the problem first try because I could not understand it. Some of these problems are written in a way that makes them almost impossible to understand.
I will keep doing more.

## Day 17: 09/23/25: Did a palindrom problem; the one I solved plenty of times
Did valid palindrom today. Pretty easy problem as it just takes two strings and compares or just iterates through the one with two pointers in o n 

## Day 18: 09/25/25: Did another Stack Problem
I did a stack  problem today, it was a medium and I managed to get a brute force solution which I guess is imporovment. I need to practice stacks

## Day 19: 09/26/25: Did a Couple of Easy/Medium Problems
I did two stack problems while at work. Got the group anagrams problem down.

Ended up doing another easy problem later on that involved encoding and decoding strings

## Day 20: 10/4/25: Got Sick, Back at it. Did Popular Problem
I was sick for a week but got back on the LC grind. Did most water medium today; its a simple two pointer problem so it was fine.
Going to keep on trucking.

## Day 21 ish: 10/7/25: Forgot to do journal
Forgot to do the journal thing. Did a couple of problems dealing with stacks and sets and forgot to update but github reflects the updates

## Day 22: 10/8/25: Did a Problem in Under 20 Minutes First Try
Did an easy problem today and I got optimum time and space complexity in the first try. It was a bucket sort problem so that felt kinda good. Still need to worry about other problems but I can see progress.

## Day 23: 10/9/25: Did An Easy Problem
Did an easy problem at work today. I have honestly no idea how the problem works. It was a simple two pointer problem but I had no idea how the logic works. I just sent it and it worked.

Did another one

## Day 24: 10/12/25: Did Stack Problems
Did a stack problem today. Getting back in the hang of things. I need to get stack down and then do some graphs and I should be good to go
Did another stack problem, just append and see if last three characters are == 'abc'

Did the first tree problem of the season. maximum depth

## Day 25: 10/13/25: Did Weird Problem
Today I did a problem that was a simple reduction problem. The idea here is that you will scan through an array and pop from the index -1 point if you see an anagram.

It made optimal time complexity. It was similiar to the many anagrams problem

## Day 26: 10/14/25: Did Easy That Failed
Today I did an easy problem that I actually could not figure out on my own. The problem was poorly explained and I had this crazy long soluion.

Another user had a much easier solution so that was nice.

## Day 27 : 10/15/25: Did Rotated Sorted Array
Today I attempted to do a medium problem and could not get it in time. I had several problems but I will keep trying.
Also did palindromic substring. Had the right idea down just did not flush it out all the way.
Did my first linked list of the iteration.

## Day 28: 10/15/25: Did Two Pointer
Did a two pointer question today. At first had a hard time getting it but eventually got it.
Got my first two pointer medium problem done via sorting. This was problem number 2491

## Day 29: 10/17/25: Did Valid Palindrom Today again
Did valid palindrom again today. Was pretty simple and I got it first try which was kinda nice.

Also did two sum II, input array is sorted. Got it on first try unlike the other night. Getting pretty good at two pointers

Also did number of distinct averages

## Day 30: 10/18/25: Did Two Pointer
Today is two pointer day, did valid palinbdrome again to warm up. Also can't spell.

Did a couple of sorting probmlems and rotate-list problem.

Did sort by rarity easy. And did number of strings that appear as substring

## Day 31: 10/19/25: Did Linked List
Did return middle of linked list problem. Was pretty simple and got it first try in optimal time and space complexity. Getting pretty good at the easy stuff.

Also did a binary search and sort problem.

## Day 32: 10/20/25: Did Medium Stack
Started to do stacks since I think I don't get the monotomic stuff intutivly. Going to knock out a couple of problems today.
Did a stack medium problem that was super simple.
Did verify preorder traversal problem.

## Day 33: 10/21/25: Did Easy Today; Lazy
I was not feeling leetcode at all today I just did one easy stack problem regarding multiplying or something like that.
It was Baseball-game leetcode; just use a stack and perform operations as you see them.

## Day 34: 10/22/25: Did Easy Stack Today; Had a Movie
Did not have much time to dedicate to LC tonight. I got off work and then had to go to see a movie so that ate into alot of my time.
I have kept the streak alive.

## Day 35: 10/23/25: Did Easy Stacks
Still doing stack problems. Going to start doing medium problems now as I think I have the hang of easy stack problems now.
Did an easy stack tonight since I am having to work late.
Did remove all occurances of substring. Is medium and was pretty simple

## Day 36: 10/24/25: Did Linked List Medium
Did a linked list medium problem today. It was listed as a medium but I actually got it done pretty easy. It should probobly be listed as a easy
Also did a problem for doubling up numbers. Not sure why github is not marking my commit

## Day 37: 10/26/25: Flew to St.Louis for Work
I had to fly to st.louis today for work. Deffinitly an intresting city. I am here until Thursday morning at 5:00 am. Did daily temperatures problem today and for whatever reason I thoguht it was buy/sell stock problem. Submitted the right answer for that problem but it was not hte right answer for the problem.

I will continue to do LC while I am up here but it might be less.
I did an easy stack problem as well. Clear-digits might be the easiest stack problem. These are getting pretty easy.
