#this is not a lc problem; instead I am going to provide an example of async code in Python. Python is not the best code to run it in but this allows us to run several coommands of python at the 'same time.' In reality the program will pause and then start back up again.

import asyncio
import time

async def sleep():
    print(f'Time: {time.time() - start:.2f}')
    time.sleep(1)

async def sum(name, numbers):
    total = 0
    for number in numbers:
        print(f'Task {name}: Computing {total}+{number}')
        await sleep()
        total += number
    print(f'Task {name}: Sum = {total}\n')

start = time.time()

loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
tasks = [
    loop.create_task(sum("A", [1, 2])),
    loop.create_task(sum("B", [1, 2, 3])),
]
loop.run_until_complete(asyncio.wait(tasks))
loop.close()

end = time.time()
print(f'Time: {end-start:.2f} sec')
