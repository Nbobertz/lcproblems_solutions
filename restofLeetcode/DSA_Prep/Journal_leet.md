# Purpose of this journal is to provide a log of the Data Structures an algorithms that I am working on after work.

## Day 1: 07/27/25 (Getting Started and Arrays)
I have done about 200 leetcode questions and have a pretty solid grasp of everything but it still takes me about 20 minutes to solve a medium problem. The idea here is to get to the point that I can solve a hard first try in about 20 minutes. It's going to take time, but fortunately it is possible.

I am a software engineer during the day but need to get better. This is a great medium to do it. I plan to follow the [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) roadmap for the first 50 days and aim to do two or three problems a day.

I will brush up on arrays and hashmaps today.

Did two sum and learned about the python.items() function to iterate through dictionary items. Also did group anagrams and learned the trick about grouping via aski values. A tricky question where you have to know the trick

## Day2: 07/29/25: Arrays and Hashmaps
Got pretty good at iterating through an array and hashmap tonight. There are still some problems which are hard. Namely the ones that require you to stop and think about the solution or ones that use bitwise.

I did the valid palindrome question and the optimol solution was the bitwise one; which nobody would get in an interview but I guess I will have to memorise it. Essentially the ~ operator will flip all bits and you can compare directlly; this is a O(1) solution since all you have to do is just flip and judge to see if the bits match up.

## Day3: 07/30/25: Two Pointer, Array and Hashmaps
Today was a good day, did three problems and got through all 3. Two of them I had to look at the most efficent solution. This was because one of them requires you to const a memo and then edit it as you go through the problem. This was product of array except self.

The one pass soluion is a bit cracked. You have to do range(n-1,-1,-1) which says take the range of n, go backwards to -1, and the step is -1. To do this on the spot in an interview is a bit mean but some interverviewers be like that.

Anyways, it was a good day for DSA because it's all starting to come back now.

## Day4: 07/31/25: Two Pointer, 3Sum
Did 3 sum today and it broke me; spent about an hour on it learning diffrent ways to iterate through. Understand a majority of it but failed to see the implication. I will have to do it again before moving on.

Overall good day though; work thinks I do hobby work at the office which sucks. I built an AI-Program but they think I am just messing around. Kinda sucks but whatever.

## Day5: 08/1/25: Two Pointer, 3 Sum Smaller
Did 3 sum smaller today along with several other LC problems. The problem is that I am having a hard time grasping the inheret problem and assuming to much. I need to slow down; it's insane that you have to do these problems hundreds of times to get a job but its whatever.

I did the smaller version of it and I am tired of failing to grasp and move the pointers properly. I will continue to try

## Day6: 08/02/25: Array Based Questions
I have come to the conclusion that I am going to follow the neetcode roadmap but do all the leetcode questions for that topic before doing the neetcode ones. I just need to spend more time on these algorithms.

I did a couple of array based problems today. Going to see if I can get my haircut and then come back to the grind.

## Day7: 08/03/25: Array Based Questions
Did an easy today that I just could not get. I continue to overthink and impliment extremly hard solutions to what should be simple problems. I will continue to work hard and hopefully be able to solve mediums in under 20 minutes first try. I think at this rate I might be about 20 days off.

## Day8: 08/05/25: Two Pointer Problems
Did most water today (medium) it was about finding the largest container to hold water. I ahve done the hard version of this problem before.
Got the brute force approach but could not get the optimal without help. 

## Day 9: 08/07/25: Did A Graph Problem Today
Did the number of islands problem today. It's a classic graph problem that I think is one of the best leetcode problems out there. Got it after several attempts; did the iterative solution.

## Day 10: 08/10/24: Did Wiggle Sort
Tooday I did wiggle sort, it's a pretty cool problem on how to fix an array in real time. I would recomend doing this one as it shows how you can edit an array in place without storing and returning anything. A solid way to change things.

Also did the max consecutive one's problem. Got the algorithm down but failed to get the impimentation down. I need to brush up on my sliding window algorithm to make sure I can get it first try.

Did this in a group of people so it was more difficult.

## Day 11: 09/16/25: Did Bucket sort
Dropped off for a month. Grandpa died and I got sent to DC for work but now I am back on the grind. Did bucket sort today so that was pretty cool.
Still working on getting better.

## Day 12: 09/17/25: Did A stack Problem
Did a common stack problem and managed to get the brute force solution first try. It was a medium, so I guess that is new. Still I have alot to go.
Also I did the easy valid parenthesis problem. The logic is what gets me on it but I understand how a stack works.

## Day 13: 09/18/25: Did two stack problems
Did two stack problems today. One of them I brute forced my way through and got an O(n*m) solution. It was find next greater integer. The proper way to do it was with a monotonic(linear) stack. I need to get better at grasping these stack problems. For some reason I am good with graphs, but stacks...noooo... lol.

Anyways, standard day. Tomarrow I will try to get a problem in but I need to go to a concert.

## Day 14: 09/20/25: Did Bucket Sort Today at Kava bar
Yesterday I had to go to a concert so I did not get a chance to do a new problem. Today I did bucket sort again to make sure I got it down.

Will probobly do another one before bed.

## Day 15: 09/21/25: Did Bucket Sort Again and Car Fleet
Did bucket sort with colors today as well as with car fleet problem. The car fleet one I missed because I was trying to calculate each car as if it was on a track and not just do the time to complete and have some logic.
It's one of those problems where if you have done it before you will pass easily.

The bucket sort colors one was pretty intresting. I did it at work by using a LLM model to give me a random problem.

## Day 16: 09/22/25: Did an easy that I did not get today
I did dominoes 1128 today. I did not get the problem first try because I could not understand it. Some of these problems are written in a way that makes them almost impossible to understand.
I will keep doing more.

## Day 17: 09/23/25: Did a palindrom problem; the one I solved plenty of times
Did valid palindrom today. Pretty easy problem as it just takes two strings and compares or just iterates through the one with two pointers in o n 

## Day 18: 09/25/25: Did another Stack Problem
I did a stack  problem today, it was a medium and I managed to get a brute force solution which I guess is imporovment. I need to practice stacks

## Day 19: 09/26/25: Did a Couple of Easy/Medium Problems
I did two stack problems while at work. Got the group anagrams problem down.

Ended up doing another easy problem later on that involved encoding and decoding strings

## Day 20: 10/4/25: Got Sick, Back at it. Did Popular Problem
I was sick for a week but got back on the LC grind. Did most water medium today; its a simple two pointer problem so it was fine.
Going to keep on trucking.

## Day 21 ish: 10/7/25: Forgot to do journal
Forgot to do the journal thing. Did a couple of problems dealing with stacks and sets and forgot to update but github reflects the updates

## Day 22: 10/8/25: Did a Problem in Under 20 Minutes First Try
Did an easy problem today and I got optimum time and space complexity in the first try. It was a bucket sort problem so that felt kinda good. Still need to worry about other problems but I can see progress.

## Day 23: 10/9/25: Did An Easy Problem
Did an easy problem at work today. I have honestly no idea how the problem works. It was a simple two pointer problem but I had no idea how the logic works. I just sent it and it worked.

Did another one

## Day 24: 10/12/25: Did Stack Problems
Did a stack problem today. Getting back in the hang of things. I need to get stack down and then do some graphs and I should be good to go
Did another stack problem, just append and see if last three characters are == 'abc'

Did the first tree problem of the season. maximum depth

## Day 25: 10/13/25: Did Weird Problem
Today I did a problem that was a simple reduction problem. The idea here is that you will scan through an array and pop from the index -1 point if you see an anagram.

It made optimal time complexity. It was similiar to the many anagrams problem

## Day 26: 10/14/25: Did Easy That Failed
Today I did an easy problem that I actually could not figure out on my own. The problem was poorly explained and I had this crazy long soluion.

Another user had a much easier solution so that was nice.

## Day 27 : 10/15/25: Did Rotated Sorted Array
Today I attempted to do a medium problem and could not get it in time. I had several problems but I will keep trying.
Also did palindromic substring. Had the right idea down just did not flush it out all the way.
Did my first linked list of the iteration.

## Day 28: 10/15/25: Did Two Pointer
Did a two pointer question today. At first had a hard time getting it but eventually got it.
Got my first two pointer medium problem done via sorting. This was problem number 2491

## Day 29: 10/17/25: Did Valid Palindrom Today again
Did valid palindrom again today. Was pretty simple and I got it first try which was kinda nice.

Also did two sum II, input array is sorted. Got it on first try unlike the other night. Getting pretty good at two pointers

Also did number of distinct averages

## Day 30: 10/18/25: Did Two Pointer
Today is two pointer day, did valid palinbdrome again to warm up. Also can't spell.

Did a couple of sorting probmlems and rotate-list problem.

Did sort by rarity easy. And did number of strings that appear as substring

## Day 31: 10/19/25: Did Linked List
Did return middle of linked list problem. Was pretty simple and got it first try in optimal time and space complexity. Getting pretty good at the easy stuff.

Also did a binary search and sort problem.

## Day 32: 10/20/25: Did Medium Stack
Started to do stacks since I think I don't get the monotomic stuff intutivly. Going to knock out a couple of problems today.
Did a stack medium problem that was super simple.
Did verify preorder traversal problem.

## Day 33: 10/21/25: Did Easy Today; Lazy
I was not feeling leetcode at all today I just did one easy stack problem regarding multiplying or something like that.
It was Baseball-game leetcode; just use a stack and perform operations as you see them.

## Day 34: 10/22/25: Did Easy Stack Today; Had a Movie
Did not have much time to dedicate to LC tonight. I got off work and then had to go to see a movie so that ate into alot of my time.
I have kept the streak alive.

## Day 35: 10/23/25: Did Easy Stacks
Still doing stack problems. Going to start doing medium problems now as I think I have the hang of easy stack problems now.
Did an easy stack tonight since I am having to work late.
Did remove all occurances of substring. Is medium and was pretty simple

## Day 36: 10/24/25: Did Linked List Medium
Did a linked list medium problem today. It was listed as a medium but I actually got it done pretty easy. It should probobly be listed as a easy
Also did a problem for doubling up numbers. Not sure why github is not marking my commit

## Day 37: 10/26/25: Flew to St.Louis for Work
I had to fly to st.louis today for work. Deffinitly an intresting city. I am here until Thursday morning at 5:00 am. Did daily temperatures problem today and for whatever reason I thoguht it was buy/sell stock problem. Submitted the right answer for that problem but it was not hte right answer for the problem.

I will continue to do LC while I am up here but it might be less.
I did an easy stack problem as well. Clear-digits might be the easiest stack problem. These are getting pretty easy.

## Day 38: 10/29:25: Leaving St.Louis and Did Some Work
Just let st.louis and sitting in the airport doing leetcode right now. Did a bit problem I have to remember that he bin() function will convert an integr into binary so that we can deal with the problems that involve binary.

There was a o(1) time and space complexity but I messed it up. Whatever.
Also did another problem where I just had to replace the first 6 with a 9. Pretty easy stuff and glad that I am doing the easy problems while on vacation.

## Day 39: 11/1/25: Did this at 1 AM
Took a day off for Halloween! Did a stack problem today and got it first try as a medium in under 20 minutes. Getting pretty good at these.

It was ocean view buildings stack problem. So pretty happy with the result.

## Day 40: 11/1/25: Did More Problems Today
Ok, so I did more problems today. I think I did one or two stack problems and a couple of linked list prooblems. Got a medium first try for linked list. It was the add two numbers II problem (445).

I think I am getting pretty good at this. Also I am going to see how long I can fast for.

## Day 41: 11/2/25: Doing Sliding Window Now
I have done sliding window before but I am folloing the neet roadmap so now it's sliding window time. Just did the buy/sell stock problem and got it first try but that is easy.

Did maximum length substring problem. Was an easy but got stuck. Need to work on sliding window problems.

## Day 42: 11/3/25: Doing Binary Search Again
I feel like I need to go back to basics. Did two binary search problems today. First was the binary search problem, the second was the matrix binary search.

Both were pretty simple
Also did a math problem

Just did Koko, not simple.
Did find min in rotated sorted arrray. Kinda had the idea but could not finish it

## Day 43: 11/4/25: Did A Greedy
Kinda bouncing aroudn here. Did a problem I thought was a stack but it was a greedy; I don't even know greedy lol. Obviously I got it wrong so I need to go back and practice sliding window and stuff like that.

Also I want to get into RAG so that might be cool for work

Did teh repeated dna sequence leetcode problem. Got it firs try in under 10 mintues doing sliding window. Pretty good but keep going.

## Day 44: 11/5/25: Did Sliding Window Again
Did another sliding window problem that required to find anagrams in an array. I got the o log n solution which was not optimal but it did work.

The proper solution was to create a map of frequency and then just check to se if the string slice matched up to the slice.

It was close enought and a medium

## Day 45: 11/5/25: Did Stack Problem And Got NonOptimal
I did a stack problem today and failed to get the opimal solution but it went through. I think my solution was o(n) but the problem might have been o(1). The idea is that you will remove all k subsequent characters that are the same and return the array after it has been collapsed. This is the palantir problem.

It might be a bitwise problem. Was not, just was idiot in how I wrote the code and had an extra loop.

Also did most rainwater medium. got it first try after not having done it in forever.

## Day 46: 11/8/25: Did Linked List Problem
Did a linked list problem where you had to go through a linked list and return all numbers greater to the right.
My solution was not optimal but it got on the board so that works I guess.

## Day 47: 11/9/25: Did Easy Subraction Problem
Did a problem today where it was just subracting continously until one number hit 0.

Got stuck on an easy problem. Goign to take a break for an hour or so

Also had to do the other easy divid by zero problem.

Was pretty simple.

## Day 48: 11/10/25: Did Easy Subtraction and Medium
Started off the night with an easy problem. It was just subtracting from the string until the characters were not in there.
Was pretty easy to do.

Working on monotomic stacks as they always trip me up. Did another and kinda got it.

I need to get better at monotomic stacks

## Day 49: 11/11/25: Did Easy and Got Interview
Got an interview with AWS today. It's time to start grinding out all AWS problems.
Did several medium problems today, was just beating my head against the wall. Great...
Anyways I did them.

## Day 50: 11/13/25: Did Problems Yesterday Just did not Update
Today I am really grinding out the possible AWS problems. I read mixed results online which sucks but hey at least I am doing them all.

Did movie times problem, did two pointer and got it first try

Did First Unique letter in string

Did find binary string

## Day 51: 11/15/25: Did BFS Problems Today
Went out last night and missed leetcode; all well.

Today I did a bfs solution problem. It came pretty naturally which was nice

## Day 52: 11/16/25: Did BFS and Sort Problem Today Before Work
Today I first tried the Minimum-Distance-between values in bfs tree. Was kinda nice to get it with optimal time and space complexity first try.
I have to got to work so I will knock out more problems when I get back.

## Day 53: 11/17/25: Did Hashmap Lookup
Did a quick problem today where you have a list of characters in a string and you want to return the first one that is repeated.

The idea is that you iterate through everything and if you see it repeated twice you return it. Pretty easy.

## Day 54: 11/18/25: Did Multiply Problem
Did a problem tonight that was literally just x *= 2 and check if in array. Was pretty easy

Did a couple word search stuff as well and two mediums for sub-arrays

## Day 55: 11/19/25: Knocking Out Monotomic Stacks
Started heading straight into Monotomic Stack problems. Got the first one 'daily temps' pretty easy. It was a introdutory one. Going to do more monotomic stacks.

Just did building problem and got it first try using a monotomic stack. Need to do more to solidify since I am going on vacation for a whole week.

Did another montomic medium problem and solved it in less then 10 minutes. Pretty good about that one. That is 3 monotomics in less then an hour.

## Day 56: 12/1/25: Went on Vacation
Went out on vacation for work. Spent the entire time not doing Leetcode but now I am back on the grid.

Did an array problem to warm up. Did another array problem taht involved strings. Did spiral matrix problem. Did number of islands problem as well. Did largest island size problem. Also did permitted of Island on Graph. Also did diamate of binary tree problem. Did subtree of another tree. Also did game of life.

Total for today = around 10

## Day 57: 12/2/25: Grinding It Out
Today I started with inversing a linked list. I am going to nonstop do linked list problems today.

Did inverse linked list twice, then attempted linked list 2. Also did pally-linked list. Did remove_nodes_from_linked_list on first go using a monotomic stack and linked list combo; feel pretty good about that. Did delete_node_in_linked_list with help. Also did remove linked list elements. Also did remove center of linked list. Also did middle of linked list. Did Linked list Components as well.

Total today is 9

## Day 58: 12/3/25: Doing Tree's Today
Today we are doing nothing but tree problems. 

Just got done doing invert binary tree. Did max-depth binary tree. Also I did a balanced binary tree problem via recursive dfs. Did Same Tree. Did inorder tree traversal via bfs. Did Binary Tree Level Order Transversal. Did Average on each floor. Did sumleft tree. Also did shortest word distance in two pointer pass

Total for today so far is 9

## Day 59: 12/4/25: Doing BackTracking Today
Today is nothing but backtracking. I already did two problems. The first is max subsets and the second was subsets II.
The first problem I needed to do was a bit hard the second I got pretty easy. Did subsets 1 again after. Did combonation sum with healp from neetcode.

Also did generate parenthesis with help from Leetcode but I got it after shown the code.

Also did word search, had the concept down but could not get the final answer to save my life. I need to practice graph dfs problems.

Tried a lc hard. It was wordsearch 2. Got 90% of a solution working.
Did another stack problem.


Total so far is 6

## Day 60: 12/5/25: About to GI Plus Graphs Later
About to go into Gallatin. Did a LC problem to warm up.

This was some leetcode easy problem. Got it in under 10 minutes.

Did great, really knocked it out of the park and did everything perfectly.

Still doing LC though. Doing nothing but graphs today to warm up. Did number of islands

Kinda got a bfs solution. Just did not understand the problem

Total today 3. Friday and tired.

## Day 61: 12/6/25: Did Graphs And Recursion
Getting pretty good but still not there.
Today I did one question so far. Have a headache.

## Day 62: 12/7/25: Doing Nothing But DP today
Started doing DP today. Going to do nothign but DP today and see how far I can get

Started off with counting stairs. Did fibinonanci number. Also did min cost climbing stairs. Did nth tribonachi

Need alot of work on DP but getting it. Did one that I did not put here, had to copy result because it was top right to bottom left of grid. Did another one regardign alice and bob takign turns with odd numbers. Also did house robber.

Total for today 7

## Day 63: 12/8/25: Did Montonic Stack
Did the An int today. Absolutly destroyed it and I think I did good. The problem delth with having to iterate over a input log of zones and determin what was in teh time stamp. zone1 = [('dog',1),('cat',2)] and return what animal was in the time stamp if there was none we just return the previous seen thing in the zone.

Also did a monotonic stack problem but purposly taking today off to recover

## Day 64: 12/9/25: Failed A Int
While I gave a good solution it was not the optiomal one, kinda of a bummer because the guy said I passed in the interview.
Looking back over the problem it is clear it was a binary search solution but I could not think of it.
That makes 4 LC interviews I have failed. I will have to keep going.

Did about 3 questions today. Going to keep it alive. Doing nothing but binary search problems today. Did about 3/4 binary search problems. Need to do more binary search

Did an easy array problem just to make myself feel better.

Going to start doing mock assesments tonight every night after practice. The idea is to build good habits for random questions. Did two more assesments. Got pretty good results for both

## Day 65: 12/10/25: Keep Going
Had a bad day yesterday but I will keep doing these problems. Did a daily graph one today and kinda got the solution. As always I need to slow down and read the question several times. The problem comes down to reading and not getting and the constraints.

Did 1 graph today.

## Day 66: 12/11/25: Did First Medium DP By Myself
As the title suggests I did the first DP problem by myself today. It was a medium and I almost got it 100 % first try. I did not store teh calculation properly.

It was Taking Maximium Energy. Further, I did an assesment and did fliping and image and leaf similar trees.

Did 3 problems today

## Day 67: 12/15/25: Took Some Time Off
Path of Exile 2 came out, no lifed that for a couple days and now back at it. Did a problem just to get back into it. It was a sliding window problem that was marked as dynamic programing but I solved it in o(n) time. Not sure.

Did a dfs traversal and postorder. Did another one where I sum up stuff as I see it

Problems today 5

## Day 68: 12/15/25: Did Trees

But I will keep going.

## Day 78: 12/28/25: Was At Event, Finally Got Back
I had to go to an event today, finally got back. I am going to keep notes on each problem I solve along with the pattern. Further I started doing these steps for each problem
First, read the problem out-loud. Ask clarrifying questions give an example input and an example output
Second, capture edge constraints. What if there was negative numbers for example
Third, talk about the possible algorithms and data structures we could use
Fourth, start coding up a solution
Fifth, explain your code
Sixth, run code and think of optimisations.

Doing two pointer like this today. Problems done so far =4

## Day 79: 12/31/25: Took Two Days Off For Holidays
Took two days off for the holidays. Also I found a sheet online of most popular patterns so I am going to do those. Its about 300 problems but I think it's worth it as it has the sub-patterns.

So far I have done 5 today.

## Day 80: 1/1/26: Happy New Year
Happy new year! We are already in 2026 and still doing leetcode. Warmed up with 3sum today and going to continue on. Still working on all patterns for two pointer.

So far did 2 today.

## Day 81: 1/3/26: Leetcoding it up

Just did an easy problem by myself in under 5 minutes so tahts pretty good.

So far did 3

## Day 82: 1/4/26: Doing Leetcode
Geting pretty good at medium problems now. I think next time I will get it.
Doing nothing but modyfing in place arrays now

So far did 3

## Day 83: 1/5/26: Doing Convergence Again
Today I am doing convergence (3sum) again. Just got to keep grinding. I found it hard to conceptually solve the problem but I am getting there. Did a normal problem and as usual overcomplicated it. Two-sum input array is sorted can be solved with two pointer. Did another linked list problem

Today I did 5 problems

## Day 84: 1/6/26: Doing String Reversal
Got pinged for Microsoft interview today. Got to start the grind more then usual.
Today starting with string reversal

Did 8 today - 4 problems, 4 for assesement

Grade on the assesment is 100% as I got both in about 12 minutes with optimal time and space. On the second assesment I got 100% as well, it was flipping an image and leaf nodes of a tree

Did two assesments for Microsoft

## Day 85: 1/7/26: Doing Nothing But Binary Search
Doing nothing but binary search today to get familiar with the patterns.

## Day 87: 1/9/26: Still Doing Binary Search
Still doing binary search. It's taking some time because I wan't to make sure I get it down.
Did an apple assesemtn and didnt pass because it was a math problem where you had to know a trick.

I have done 5 so far.

## Day 88: 1/11/26: Did LinkedList and Graph
Did some MC interview problems in anticipaton for the upcoming round. I think I am going to do good but even if I don't I will continue going.
Did 4 today

## Day 89: 1/12/26: About to Go Into MSFT
Here we go again. I did some DSA to prepare but I am going to wing it and see how I do.
Did 2 so far today. 3 if you count what this guy is about to give me.
Wish me luck.

## Day 90: 1/13/26: Did MSFT and Passed
Got through the tech screen, it was a dp problem (fibonachi sequence) and I got 90% of the the problem and all edge constraints. Was not updating memo at first.

Really tired today so i am only doing a couple of heap problems. Outside that its pretty normal
Did 1 so far

## Day 91: 1/14/26: Back on the grind
Here we are again, back on the grind.
Doing nothing but heaps today. Figured I could get them down after a while

Did 3/4 heap problems. Also did a medium level assesment and got 1 of 3 right but spent 1.5 hours doing it so in total
I did max of 7 problems

## Day 92: 1/15/26: MSFT GRIND Here WE GO!
Ok, so I got the confirmation. MSFT is intrested in me for 4 positions. It is time for me to live eat and breath leetcode and systems design.

This means I need to get a study plan and stick to it. I am going to do the neetcode 250 and grind it out. I am going to reset the progress and do about 10-15 problems per day. I will try to schedule it for the first week in February.

I will also do 1/2 systems designs per day.

## Day 93: 1/16/26: MSFT Grind Doing Stack
So my idea is to do all the neetcode 250 in two weeks. Further, I will do 1-2 assesments per day and 1 systems design with taking notes

Today we are doing stack.

Did 7 so far and did an assesment. Did ok on all and got the intuition but not the problem.

Also did fizzbuzz but that one does not count.

## Day 94: 1/16/26: Doing Backtracking, DP, and Graphs Today; 400 PROBLEMS!!!
Doing nothing but DP, Graphs, and Backtracking today. Further, going to do two systems designs with notes.

So far did 6

ALSO I HIT 400 PROBLEMS Today!!!

## Day 95: 1/18/26: Doing Backtracking and DP
Doing nothing but backtracking and DP today. Also doing systems diagrams

Did 3 so far today. Also did an assesement, could not finish it.... Been doing Leetcode for so long it's getting hard to progress fast. Need to constant strugle to make it through.

## Day 96: 1/19/26: Doing Nothing But Intervals and Graphs
Today I am doing nothing but interval quetions and graphs. THe trick to intervals is to sort them

## Day 97: 1/20/26: 6 Days To MSFT
Got the word today, 6 days to prep. Have to grind it out.

Also did 3 leetcode problems. Did a sliding window one first try which was kinda nice

## Day 100 : 1/23/26: 3 Days to MSFT
Getting some jumpyness now, been doing these problems nonstop. Going to do DP for a bit and then step into graphs to polish up. After that go to DP and keeep going.
I also saw a coderpad for each interview so I might stop doing systems design; maybe. The recruiter is non-responsie

Did 9 problems today so far

## Day 101: 1/24/26: 2 Days to MSFT
Two days to go, doing nothing but array graphs today alogn with some DP. Going to do systems and most popular questions
Hope I pass
