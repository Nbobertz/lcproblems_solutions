This dir is designed to house leetcode problems I have done. I have many more on LC itself but this is the sample amount I have done so far in the IDE

Vim sucks. I heard a good joke the other day. An interviewer asked a candidate their experience using their company preferred IDE, VIM...

The candidate said "Oh I have about 3 years of experience using VIM....mainly because I can't figure out how to exit and just leave the 'IDE' up"

I have to use VIM all the time at work. It sucks. In good news I think I got the hang of GIT

I am writing this from a train right now with the hotspot connected to my computer. Pretty cool stuff.

08/29/24: Got stumped on a list-transversal question. Feel stupid that I had to look up Neetcode.

09/02/24: It's labor day!

09/05/24: Started just throwing all problems in the dir 'restofLeetcode'. This is because it will prevent folders from cluttering my desktop. Go to 'restofLeetcode' directory and open up each individual .py for each problem.

09/10/2024: Forgot leetcode yesterday and today I was traveling to Melbourne. I will attempt to get a leetcode problem done today/tomarrow.

03/12/2024: Still in Florida. Will attempt Leetcode today

09/21/2024: Got back from Florida last week and was super sick. Finally got over it so back to LC.

10/1/24: started doing two LC a day
