This dir is designed to house leetcode problems I have done. I have many more on LC itself but this is the sample amount I have done so far in the IDE

Vim sucks. I heard a good joke the other day. An interviewer asked a candidate their experience using their company preferred IDE, VIM...

The candidate said "Oh I have about 3 years of experience using VIM....mainly because I can't figure out how to exit and just leave the 'IDE' up"

I have to use VIM all the time at work. It sucks. In good news I think I got the hang of GIT

I am writing this from a train right now with the hotspot connected to my computer. Pretty cool stuff.

08/29/24: Got stumped on a list-transversal question. Feel stupid that I had to look up Neetcode.

09/02/24: It's labor day!

09/05/24: Started just throwing all problems in the dir 'restofLeetcode'
